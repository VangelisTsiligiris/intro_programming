<h3><strong>Coursework Brief: Python for Data Science and GUI Development</strong></h3>
<p>This coursework focuses on applying Python programming skills in data science and GUI development. You will work with a publicly available dataset, utilising control structures, functions, and external modules to perform data analysis. The task includes handling data using Pandas, generating visualisations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, and building a simple GUI with Tkinter or PyQt.</p>
<p>You are required to document your code clearly, adhere to coding standards, and submit a comprehensive report explaining your methodology and findings. Version control is an essential component; you must use GitHub to track your progress, ensuring regular commits with detailed commit messages.</p>
<p>The coursework is structured into six sections: control structures, functions and modules, data handling with Pandas, data visualization, GUI development, and version control/reporting. Each section contributes to the overall mark, with a total of 100 marks available.</p>
<p>By completing this coursework, you will strengthen your ability to analyze real-world data, apply Pythonâ€™s data science libraries, and design user interfaces, along with gaining experience in using GitHub for professional development.</p>
<h3><strong>Deliverables</strong>: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and a GitHub repository link showing version control throughout the project.</h3>
