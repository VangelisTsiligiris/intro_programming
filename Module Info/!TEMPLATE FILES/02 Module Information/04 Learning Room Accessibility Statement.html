<h2>About accessibility</h2>
<p>At NTU we endeavour to ensure that no students are disadvantaged when it comes to accessing the systems and resources we use. We understand that students may require assistive technologies, or prefer to engage in content on their own devices or in their own way. We cater for this by putting accessibility at the forefront of our thoughts when designing, creating or selecting materials to share with you.</p>
<h2>Learning Room compliance</h2>
<p>The current overall accessibility compliance level for the content within this Learning Room is:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>XX%</strong></span></p>
<main>
<p>This score was last revised on <strong>DD/MM/YYYY</strong> using the Blackboard Ally integration, which assesses the content of this Learning Room against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure compliance, highlighting those items that require improvement.</p>
<h2>Roadmap to improved accessibility</h2>
<p>Whilst every effort is made to ensure all the materials we provide you are accessible, there may be some occasions where it is not possible to make a resource entirely accessible. This could be related to the time needed to do so, the availability of technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, or the caption accuracy on videos. There may also be third party resources needed or used within this Learning Room that aren't fully compliant and which we cannot modify.</p>
<p>These items listed below will be improved in due course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 1 (e.g. Lecture Capture recordings with no captions or poor accuracy)</li>
<li>Item 2 (e.g. PowerPoint presentations with multiple images that require Alt text adding)</li>
<li>Item 3 (e.g. PDF scans of hand-written notes that have not been OCR'd)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requesting support with inaccessible files or features</h2>
<p>If you locate any resource within this Learning Room that you cannot access for any reason, please contact <strong>MODULE LEADER&nbsp;NAME&nbsp;</strong>on&nbsp;<strong>TEL NUMBER&nbsp;</strong>or email&nbsp;<strong>EMAIL ADDRESS.</strong></p>
<p>Please also refer to the <strong>NOW Accessibility Statement</strong> for reporting procedures for if you do not receive a timely or satisfactory response. You can also review this statement to learn how to access a range of <strong>alternative formats</strong> of common filetypes located in NOW.</p>
<h2>Third-party applications</h2>
<p>During the delivery of this module a range of non-NOW/NTU related applications may be used. These are listed below, together with the Accessibility Statements for these applications:</p>
