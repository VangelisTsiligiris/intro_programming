<main>
<h2>Module aims</h2>
<p>This Module Aims:</p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>cultivate proficiency</strong> in efficiently developing data-driven solutions for real-world, practical problems using Python programming.</li>
<li>To <strong>foster competence</strong> in using integrated development environments (IDEs) and data science tools to streamline the programming workflow.</li>
<li>To <strong>build advanced skills</strong> in procedural programming and data manipulation, enhancing problem-solving and logical thinking in the context of data science.</li>
<li>To <strong>introduce and strengthen familiarity</strong> with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and Python libraries for AI and data science, enabling the design of scalable, reusable, and maintainable code for machine learning and data analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Delivery mode</h2>
<p>The module will be delivered through a combination of <strong>in-person 2-hour lectures</strong>, providing theoretical foundations and demonstrations, and <strong>2-hour lab sessions</strong>, offering hands-on programming practice and problem-solving exercises. Additionally, <strong>1-hour optional Surgery sessions</strong> will be available weekly, allowing students to seek clarification, receive guidance on specific challenges, and enhance their understanding of the material. This balanced approach ensures both theoretical knowledge and practical application, with ample support for individual learning needs..</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Please follow the Timetables from NOW for details.</p>
<h2>Module content</h2>
<p>The <strong>SOFT40161: Introduction to Computer Programming</strong> module provides a comprehensive introduction to programming using Python, with a specific focus on its applications in data science and artificial intelligence (AI). This 10-week module is designed for students from diverse academic backgrounds, offering a blend of theoretical concepts and practical experience to develop essential programming skills.</p>
<p>The module will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python Environment Setup, Data Types, and Operations:</strong> Students will begin by setting up the Python programming environment, learning basic syntax, and understanding data types (integers, strings, floats) and operations.</li>
<li><strong>Data Structures and Control Structures:</strong> Students will explore core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) and implement control structures (loops, conditionals) for decision-making and flow control in programs.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> Students will dive into functions, including parameter passing, recursion, and handling exceptions, building modular, efficient, and reusable code.</li>
<li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Key OOP concepts like classes, objects, methods, inheritance, and constructors will be introduced to help students design structured, maintainable programs.</li>
<li><strong>Working with Data:</strong> Students will learn to manage data through file I/O operations and handle large datasets efficiently using the powerful <strong>NumPy</strong> library for numerical computations.</li>
<li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> The module introduces <strong>Pandas</strong>, a widely-used library for data manipulation, allowing students to clean, process, and analyze datasets efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Students will create informative visual representations of data using <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, from basic plots to advanced customizations.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning Fundamentals:</strong> The basics of machine learning in Python will be introduced, with students working on real-world datasets to build and evaluate simple models.</li>
<li><strong>GUI Development:</strong> Students will also learn to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Python, bringing interactivity to their applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The module’s structure combines <strong>2-hour weekly lectures</strong>, <strong>2-hour lab sessions</strong> for hands-on practice, and optional <strong>1-hour Surgery sessions</strong> to provide additional support. By the end of the module, students will have developed the foundational skills necessary to apply Python programming in real-world scenarios related to data science and AI.</p>
<h2>Peer support and collaboration</h2>
<p>Although the coursework assessment will be conducted individually, students are encouraged to collaborate and engage through various channels. During lab sessions and optional Surgery hours, students can discuss ideas, troubleshoot code, and share resources. Additionally, online discussion boards and group chats will be available for ongoing peer support. While direct collaboration on assignments is not allowed, these platforms will foster a collaborative learning environment where students can support each other’s understanding and growth.</p>
